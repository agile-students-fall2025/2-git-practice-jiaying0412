One article that I found interesting was [Choose Boring Technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) by Dan McKinley.

### What’s Interesting About Choose Boring Technology

What I find most interesting about *Choose Boring Technology* is the way it reframes the idea of innovation. Dan McKinley makes the counterintuitive but compelling argument that choosing “boring” tools is not a lack of ambition but a form of discipline. By pointing out that organizations only have a limited number of “innovation tokens,” he captures the hidden cost of adopting every shiny new framework or database: each one requires long-term investment in learning, maintenance, and troubleshooting. The image of spending these tokens wisely really stuck with me—it makes technical decision-making feel like a scarce resource problem, not just a question of taste or technical fit.

Another point I found fascinating is how the article challenges the cliché of “best tool for the job.” McKinley shows that the “best” tool isn’t always the most technically advanced one; sometimes it’s the one that’s predictable, boring, and already well understood by the team. That perspective highlights the importance of considering not just immediate performance but also organizational resilience and long-term sustainability. In a field where developers often chase novelty, the article is a refreshing reminder that stability and reliability can themselves be powerful, strategic choices.
